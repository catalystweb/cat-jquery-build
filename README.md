Demo user/admin app build v0.4

This is a demo applicaiton to demonstrate my development skills through the iterative process, this should give an in-depth overview, of my logic and thought processes as well as the execution of them.

From a practical standpoint the aim was to demonstrate competency in the usage of UI/UX responseive design, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax API calls, Cookie state management, npm build tools and libraries, task runners (gulp) as well as source control.  Testing is an ongoing process, so if you find any bugs please raise them as an issue so they may be resolved, Thanks.

Requires Node.js
1. Clone the repository (https://github.com/catalystweb/app-demo.git)
2. Run the application (npm run start)
3. Skip the initial login screen (x)
4. You may login at anytime, once you have created a test user.
